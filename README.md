Compilation of the above codes can be carried out in any version of Matlab that is compatible with any OS  and Windows, and requires no additional dependencies. However, it is better to use the Matlab 2021a version.

Here, the codes are presented to estimate the parameters.   They are written for Matlab. Other details related to the study and numerical simulations may be found in the Section **Parameter estimation and model calibration** in the  main draft.

 The experimental data are given in the files "Ch1603_experimental_data.xlsx"  and "Ch1616_experimental_data"   for validation purposes.

 For Ch1603
  1. Ch1603_validation_with_experimental_data
 For Ch1616
